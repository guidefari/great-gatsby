Writing the pitch is still part of shaping.

Part 1 of the book is Shaping.
Part 2 is Betting.
Part 3 is Building.

Just thought I'd lay out the map before we continue.

Links to some actual Basecamp pitches [here](https://public.3.basecamp.com/p/NnuPFtsAEr7ZwixxmCjs7MwU), and [here](https://public.3.basecamp.com/p/5PbZ9Srki4NW6MUnFcbKPCh7).

A pitch has 5 ingredients: Problem, Appetite, Solution, Rabbit holes, & No-gos.

# 1. Problems

> It sounds like an obvious point but it’s surprising how often teams, our own included, jump to a solution with the assumption that it’s obvious why it’s a good idea to build this thing.

When defining a problem, it's also key to identify who's facing the problem. This is a part of the strategy side of shaping.

> We could spend six weeks on an ingenious solution that only benefits a small percentage of customers known to have low retention.

# 2. Appetite
The amount of time you'll be giving to a bet. With Basecamp, it's 6 weeks, or small batch project, two weeks (or however the teams decide to split their small batch projects)

# 3. Solution
> A problem without a solution is unshaped work.

The initial theme of providing the right level of abstraction still holds true at this point. This is where you take the breadboard designs, & fat marker sketches, and make them a bit more presentable for the pitch.

# 4. Rabbit Holes
> Sometimes addressing a rabbit hole just requires a few lines of text.

# 5. No Gos
Is there anything we're not doing?


# Communication
Another thing worth mention, communication is asynchronous by default, and synchronous when need be.

> That means the first step for presenting a pitch is posting the write-up with all the ingredients above somewhere that stakeholders can read it on their own time.
