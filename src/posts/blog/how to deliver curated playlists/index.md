After compiling your playlist on your streaming platform of choice, distributing it is the next hurdle, and thanks to these services, it's not an impossible on to jump over. 

### I have the process split into two steps:

1. Converting the playlist from your platform of choice, to the rest of them. (eg from Spotify to Apple music, Deezer, YouTube, & more).
2. Creating a smart link & landing page.


# Converting the playlist

[Soundiiz](https://soundiiz.com/) has been my service of choice for this. The one big con I've experienced using Soundiiz is that the free plan has a limited number of playlists it can keep in sync. 

> That limit is a whooping 1.

That aside, it's an amazing product, and the free plan will be sufficient for most users, I think.


# Smart link & landing page

This step allows you to do some analytics, and it ties together all the converted playlists into a presentable bundle for your listener.

Whilst writing this, I've just noticed that [Soundiiz](https://soundiiz.com/) has a smart link & landing page feature, but I haven't tried it yet.

What I've tried is [Toneden](https://www.toneden.io/), and I've had nothing but good experience. [Toneden](https://www.toneden.io/) has been in the game for a while, and is still worth a look, especially if you want to create landing pages for more than just your playlists.


# Share 

That's it, you can now reach a wider audience. and since you made it to the end, [here](https://goosebumps.fanlink.to/guestmix)'s the landing page for the last playlist I shared with Soundiiz & Toneden.

Oh, I can also embed it:
