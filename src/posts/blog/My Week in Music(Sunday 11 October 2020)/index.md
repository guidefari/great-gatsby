I've mostly been shuffling through my main library, and that returned quite a mixed bag. With that said, it's mostly throwbacks.<br>

## J Dilla - Bye. [üîó](https://youtu.be/yMnJKShoOAg)

I feel like Slum Village used this beat in one of their productions, but I can't remember the track, lovely listen nonetheless.

`metro minimal` `techno` <br>

Man, these guys were probably the highlight of the week. This track was taken from their 2011 album, [Feed Forward](https://open.spotify.com/album/7qE9k9dvJP4q4rnVlCZStd?si=P-HN9hjDTpi0tHSuGEMwgw), I think I spent **all** of Tuesday listening to Sandwell District.

## 36 - Wave Variations [üîó](https://open.spotify.com/album/3IIaLiMvw6duGTQoAEOFNc?si=5bdGwb6NR2SD1LO8ciO5CA)
`ambient` `warm drone` <br>
![36 - Wave Variations](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e025af8628567fc079275a01620)
36 has quickly become a staple in my library, this is one of the artists that's influenced my current go-to coding/deep-work playlist, titled [Ambient](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5vhNkJdvdPCs7GhLZDJ7R5?si=6tRMbRjhR8u8s_YIB5Fbrw). Wave Variations is packed with warm sounds, that perfectly sit & loop in the background.<br>
Highlight tracks include [Twelfth Sequence](https://open.spotify.com/track/3LxMj7QL8jTGTp5970khkq?si=JwyJtoqgQeayP-PZec4XCQ) & [Seventh Sequence](https://open.spotify.com/track/0XMo5zTh6v5qZxkqK57Z6Z?si=-iRdopWnRzWGj52d79pKlQ).

## Sub Focus Joker - Could This Be Real (Joker Remix) [üîó](https://youtu.be/5WF5DBAVSX0?list=TLPQMTExMDIwMjBcDI9s-NFO4w)
`classic dubstep`<br>
![Sub Focus Joker - Could This Be Real (Joker Remix)](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e0282c7e2d4bf5246eaac350599)
Randomly found myself humming this song on Friday, so I quickly found it and played it 10 timesüôÇIt's as good as i remember

## Barker - Look How Hard I've Tried [üîó](https://youtu.be/rZ_cbtfDXNg?list=TLPQMTExMDIwMjBcDI9s-NFO4w)
`float house` `outsider house` `neo-trance` <br>
![Barker - Look How Hard I've Tried](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e029ce8c54b8c89952f532c5d19)
No idea how I found Barker, but I'm such a big fan of his sound. A gentle, & almost perfectly timed loopy progression, with subtle shifts that you might not catch if you don't listen close. This track is from [Debiasing EP](https://open.spotify.com/album/7wKUtfY6wtS65qsA4RRAvq?si=ha6-8uSQRp-8HAhJHJIWzw), I saved every single track from that EP, so much fun.

## dBridge - Ether [üîó](https://open.spotify.com/track/5PdSt6fmAgBO5twd1xTv4j?si=v8rilW6TR1mWCOcjiXdLuw)
`minimal dnb` `deep dubstep` <br>
![dBridge - Ether](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e0252ac597bdc88601ea96feb9c)
Hands down one of my favourite finds of the year. Such a calm, while dramatic tune from dBridge.

## Claro Intelecto - Through the Cosmos [üîó](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KCFCi8wZyko)
`float house` `techno` `idm` <br>
![Claro Intelecto - Through the Cosmos](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e028c2a15afe1c00ed2e73455b3)
It typically takes one good track to inspire a mix or a playlist for me, and Claro Intelecto has been delivering such tunes quite regularly in the past couple of months. This song has a nostalgic feel to it.

## Joji - Nectar [üîó](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLhrG05fbuPKdFR8dBbGPa2k3H3y3rspPS)
`alternative r&b` <br>
![Joji - Nectar](https://i.scdn.co/image/ab67616d00001e023f0c2963a2c09ba8d63a34ee)
Joji has been a staple for a while now, and I feel like I've been waiting forever for new tracks from him. Mixed feelings about the album as a whole, but glad to have some new Joji.
