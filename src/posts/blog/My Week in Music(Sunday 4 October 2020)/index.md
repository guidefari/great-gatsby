## Off The Meds - Wena [🔗](https://youtu.be/8HPBXd872sc)
`swedish electronic` `zulu vocals` <br>
This is the track that made me think, 'hmm, maybe I should finally write that piece'. I'm glad these guys are releasing tunes somewhat more often lately.

## featuring Jonwayne
Just when I thought I'd exhausted Jonwayne's discography, I've started bumping into projects he's featured in, and he always leads to some really good producers.

## Aphex Twin - Alberto Balsalm [🔗](https://youtu.be/mUT3KoxVzQg)
`ambient` `idm` `electronica` `experimental`<br>
'man, Aphex Twin have weird album covers sometimes' - My thoughts when I found this track. But they make good shit so whatever😂I just found out this track was released in '95 🤯

I'm not sure what you'll feel when you hear this, but you'll feel something.

## Yussef Kamal - Mansur's Message [🔗](https://youtu.be/Dqk0LtYpKEg)
`indie jazz` `indie soul`<br>
Okay so I'm cheating a bit, I played this song a lot more last week, but it's a very noteworthy mention - Took me right back to this [jam](https://youtu.be/NwVtIPeYIeQ) I found on Youtube a while ago. If anything, start with that track.

## Portable Sunsets - Ledges [🔗](https://youtu.be/DcYusIETvsg?list=TLPQMDMxMDIwMjCORiZPTQ94FA)
`ambient` `opening/closing` <br>
I'd totally open a gig with this track, it sets such a mood for jive.

## Burial Gutted [🔗](https://youtu.be/PtAuyb2onFE)
`classic dubstep` `future garage` `idm` `dub`<br>
There's a crazy percussion coming from the right speaker that I fell in love with. This has been a staple in the library for a while.
